          <h1>01. About Me </h1>
       
          <p> Over the years, I've had the opportunity to collaboate with leading experts, and I am currently a member of Swinburne University's Drugs and Driving Research Unit as well as the ICADTS Driver Monitoring System Working Group. </p>
        
         <p> My current research is centered on the development of next-generation driver monitoring system that identify driving impairment and crash risk in real-time. These systems identify distict visual scanning patterns linked to impaired driving and prompty alert the driver prevent potential road accidents. </p>

          <p> I have expertise in various analystical tools and psychometric assessments, such Forum8's UC-win/Road driving simulation software, cogntive assessment tools like CANTAB AND DRUID, as well as programming languages R and Python, among others. </p>
