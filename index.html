    <h1>BLAIR AITKEN</h1>
    <p>I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow dedicated to improving road safety through high-quality research. Currently, I'm focused on developing new methods for real-time impairment detection through ocular assessment.</p>

    <h1>01. About Me</h1>
    <p>Over the years, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with leading experts, and am currently a member of Swinburne University's Drugs and Driving Research Unit as well as the ICADTS Driver Monitoring System Working Group.</p>
    <p>My current research is centered around the development of next-generation driver monitoring systems that can detect driving impairment and crash risk in real-time. These systems identify distinct visual scanning patterns linked to impaired driving and promptly alert the driver to prevent potential road accidents.</p>
    <p>I have experience in various analytical tools and psychometric assessments, such Forum8's UC-win/Road driving simulation software, cognitive assessment tools like CANTAB AND DRUID, as well as programming languages R and Python, among others.</p>

      <h1>02. Current Project</h1>
       <p>My current research is focused on the effect of alcohol on gaze behaviour during simulated driving.
            This project, in conjunction with industry leaders Seeing Machines, intends to adapt and create
            eye-tracking technologies capable of indexing and monitoring intoxicated drivers in real-time, providing immediate alerts upon detection of driving impairment. 
            This technology represents a significant step forward in our efforts to improve road safety, particularly in an era where 
            technology is increasingly intersecting with road safety.</p>
      <p>My responsibilities include, but are not limited to, handling recruitment, data collection, management and analysis, and overall project administration.</p>
