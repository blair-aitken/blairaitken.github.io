        <h1>01. About Me</h1>
          <p>Over the years, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with leading experts, and am currently a member of Swinburne University's Drugs and Driving Research Unit as well as the ICADTS Driver Monitoring System Working Group.</p>
          <p>My current research is centered around the development of next-generation driver monitoring systems that can detect driving impairment and crash risk in real-time. These systems identify distinct visual scanning patterns linked to impaired driving and promptly alert the driver to prevent potential road accidents.</p>
          <p>I have experience in managing clinical trials, utilising a range of analytical tools and psychometric assessments. This includes proficiency with Forum8's UC-win/Road driving simulation software, cognitive assessment tools such as CANTAB AND DRUID, in addition to programming languages R and Python, among others.</p>

            <p>How seriously should we take the doctor's advice against mixing prescription medicine with alcohol, especially when driving?</p>
            <p>My thesis addressed this critical question by examining the concurrent use of prescription benzodiazepines and low-dose, or legally permitted, alcohol consumption and its impact on driving performance.
             Central to this was the exploration of neurocognitive and biobehavioural effects that contribute to an increased risk of road trauma amongst individuals who engage in polydrug use.
             Through a comprehensive approach encompassing epidemiological data, a systematic literature review, and experimental research, my aim was to determine the prevalence 
             of this behavior among high-risk drivers, quantify the impairment caused by such co-consumption, and evaluate the potential of ocular metrics as predictive indicators 
             of driving performance deterioration.</p>
